# Project 1 - Recipe search app: What's in your Fridge?
What's in your Fridge is a recipe search app with a difference: the user searches by ingredient. 

This web app is designed so that people can search recipes by the ingredients they already have, to prevent them from having to go grocery shopping, to minimise waste and to encourage creative cooking.

The user can search for any and multiple ingredients, click 'add' and then search, after which a results page is shown displaying thumbnails and the name of relevant recipes. The user can then click on a recipe and the page will display a larger image and description of the recipe, as well as allergen information, basic nutritional information, ingredients required and the method of preparation. 

The website is designed to be responsive and mobile-first, and displays nicely on all standard-size device screens including mobile phones, tablets and PCs/laptop. 

## User story
As a hungry home cook,
I want to know what meals I can create using the ingredients that I already have,
So that I can learn new recipes using everyday ingredients.

## Technologies used
HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery
Spoonacular API: for retrieving the recipes
CSS framework Animista: for the basic animation of the text in the image header
jQWidgets: for modal window, which displays when a user tries to search without entering an ingredient

## Directions for future development
* Ideally would serve a business function e.g. connects to food delivery service like Marley Spoon or even a supermarket by putting all of the missing ingredients (selected by the user) automatically into the cart 

* Filters to sort by cuisine, type of meal (snacks, dessert, breakfast etc.) allergy information, nutritional information e.g. low-fat or gluten-free, number of recipes displayed etc.

* More focus on missing ingredients e.g. option to exclude ingredients

* Option to include staple ingredients automatically e.g. butter, flour, eggs

* Auto-correct function for spelling and convert colloquialisms e.g. coriander also searches for cilantro; zucchini also searches for courgette
